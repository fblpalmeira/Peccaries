Influence of Vegetation Cover on the Abundance of Peccaries in an Area of Reforestation in southern Brazilian Amazonia

Abstract: As spatial variation in vegetation cover may influence the abundance of species at a landscape scale, abundance estimates may clarify shifts in habitat use within a vegetation mosaic. In the present study, we used camera trapping and a dynamics mix model to estimate the abundance of the white-lipped (Tayassu pecari) and collared peccaries (Pecari tajacu) in a study area in southern Brazilian Amazonia. We focused on the variation between three vegetation types – primary forest, secondary forest, and forest plantation – as potential determinants of peccary abundance. The initial abundance (λ) of T. pecari was higher in primary forest in comparison with the secondary forest and plantation. By contrast, the λ of P. tajacu did not vary significantly with vegetation cover. The expected abundance of T. pecari correlated positively with the presence of primary forest, and negatively with secondary forest and plantation. No clear correlation was found between the abundance of P. tajacu and any type of vegetation cover, however. The results of the present study provide important insights into the influence of vegetation cover on the abundance and detection of peccaries, whose ecology is still relatively poorly understood.
